# VAE-score-function
Implementation of a simple variational auto-encoder, when the latent space distribution is normal or bernoulli.

This repo contains a simple implementation of the ELBO when the latent space is modeled with a normal distribution (reparameterization trick) and when it is modeled with a bernoulli distribution (Score function estimator).
